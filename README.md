# CourseGradeExpect
## Introduction
CourseGradeExpect is a online calculator that helps students to determine if they are able to pass with their current grade (in terms of meeting specific grade requirements for different sections) and to determine what marks they need to get for the remaining assignments and exams to achieve their expected grade.

## Verisons
### cs136_cal
This version is specifically use for the grade calculation for CS136 at the University of Waterloo. In order to pass this course, students need to achieve a pass grade (50%) on the assignment section and the weighted exam section. The grade breakdown for this course is as the following:
* Assignments 20%
* Participation (iClickers) 5%
* Midterm 25%
* Final 50%

### Customized Version
This version aims to extend this tool to be used for any other courses. The client would need to manually put weights of each section of the grades in. This version is still under construction.
